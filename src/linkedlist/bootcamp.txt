Last node of singly linked list point to NULL

Last node of doubly linked list can use "self loop" or "sentinel node" to mark the end of the list

Sentinel node is node terminator, but is not necessarily a null node

Sentinel basically means to have a "node" (it can be anything) that represents end of the
node. So basically, we have a node that we share between multiple linked list to represent
the end of the linked list.
If we are using null instead, we have to make the last node point to null each time, but
with sentinel we can declare a sentinel node once and then use it all across.
